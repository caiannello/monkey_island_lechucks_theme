   To play, hook a piezo speaker between ground
   and pin 8 on your Arduino, and run the .ino 
   file. (Tested on a Nano)
   
   Note: The .INO file version is for use on 
   any Arduino. It uses the Arduino library. 
   
   The .C file version is a standalone version,
   specifically for an ATtiny85. It doesn't 
   use the Arduino library.
